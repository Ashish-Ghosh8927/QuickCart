- **Middleware**: For authentication, logging, and error handling.
- **Security**: Implementation of security best practices, including input validation, sanitization, and rate limiting.

### API Design

The API design follows RESTful principles, ensuring a stateless, client-server communication model. Key APIs include:

- **User API**: For user registration, authentication, and profile management.
- **Product API**: For product listing, details, and search.
- **Order API**: For order placement, tracking, and history.
- **Payment API**: For processing payments and managing transactions.

### Security Implementation

QuickCart implements multiple layers of security measures to protect user data and ensure secure transactions:

#### 1. Authentication System

```typescript
// JWT Token Generation and Validation
import { sign, verify } from 'jsonwebtoken';

const generateToken = (user: User): string => {
  return sign(
    {
      id: user.id,
      email: user.email,
      role: user.role,
    },
    process.env.JWT_SECRET!,
    { expiresIn: '24h' }
  );
};

const verifyToken = async (token: string): Promise<DecodedToken> => {
  try {
    const decoded = verify(token, process.env.JWT_SECRET!);
    return decoded as DecodedToken;
  } catch (error) {
    throw new AuthenticationError('Invalid or expired token');
  }
};
```

#### 2. Request Rate Limiting

```typescript
import rateLimit from 'express-rate-limit';

export const apiLimiter = rateLimit({
  windowMs: 15 * 60 * 1000, // 15 minutes
  max: 100, // Limit each IP to 100 requests per windowMs
  message: 'Too many requests from this IP, please try again later',
  standardHeaders: true,
  legacyHeaders: false,
});

// Apply to all API routes
app.use('/api/', apiLimiter);

// Stricter limits for auth routes
const authLimiter = rateLimit({
  windowMs: 60 * 60 * 1000, // 1 hour
  max: 5, // 5 attempts per hour
  message: 'Too many login attempts, please try again later',
});
app.use('/api/auth/', authLimiter);
```

#### 3. XSS Protection

```typescript
import helmet from 'helmet';

// Configure security headers
app.use(helmet({
  contentSecurityPolicy: {
    directives: {
      defaultSrc: ["'self'"],
      scriptSrc: ["'self'", "'unsafe-inline'"],
      styleSrc: ["'self'", "'unsafe-inline'"],
      imgSrc: ["'self'", "data:", "https:"],
      connectSrc: ["'self'", "https://api.razorpay.com"],
    },
  },
  crossOriginEmbedderPolicy: true,
  crossOriginOpenerPolicy: true,
  crossOriginResourcePolicy: { policy: "same-site" },
}));
```

#### 4. CSRF Protection

```typescript
import csrf from 'csurf';

const csrfProtection = csrf({
  cookie: {
    secure: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production',
    sameSite: 'strict',
  },
});

// Apply to all POST endpoints
app.use('/api', csrfProtection);

// Include CSRF token in forms
export const getCSRFToken = (req: Request) => {
  return req.csrfToken();
};
```

#### 5. Input Validation

```typescript
import { z } from 'zod';

// Product input schema
const ProductSchema = z.object({
  name: z.string().min(1).max(100),
  description: z.string().min(10).max(1000),
  price: z.number().positive(),
  category: z.string(),
  stock: z.number().int().min(0),
});

// Middleware for input validation
export const validateProduct = (req: Request, res: Response, next: NextFunction) => {
  try {
    const validatedData = ProductSchema.parse(req.body);
    req.body = validatedData;
    next();
  } catch (error) {
    res.status(400).json({ 
      error: 'Invalid input data', 
      details: error.errors 
    });
  }
};
```

#### 6. Secure Payment Processing

```typescript
import Razorpay from 'razorpay';

const razorpay = new Razorpay({
  key_id: process.env.RAZORPAY_KEY_ID,
  key_secret: process.env.RAZORPAY_SECRET,
});

export const createPaymentOrder = async (amount: number): Promise<Order> => {
  try {
    const order = await razorpay.orders.create({
      amount: amount * 100, // amount in smallest currency unit
      currency: 'INR',
      payment_capture: 1,
    });

    return {
      id: order.id,
      amount: order.amount,
      currency: order.currency,
    };
  } catch (error) {
    throw new PaymentError('Failed to create payment order');
  }
};

// Verify payment signature
export const verifyPayment = (
  orderId: string,
  paymentId: string,
  signature: string
): boolean => {
  const body = orderId + '|' + paymentId;
  const expectedSignature = crypto
    .createHmac('sha256', process.env.RAZORPAY_SECRET!)
    .update(body)
    .digest('hex');
  
  return expectedSignature === signature;
};
```

These security measures ensure:
- Secure user authentication and authorization
- Protection against common web vulnerabilities
- Safe handling of sensitive data
- Secure payment processing
- Input validation and sanitization
- Protection against brute force attacks
- Cross-site scripting (XSS) prevention
- Cross-site request forgery (CSRF) prevention

   // Product listing with server-side rendering
   async function ProductList() {
     const products = await fetchProducts();
     return (
       <div className="grid grid-cols-4 gap-4">
         {products.map(product => (
           <ProductCard key={product.id} product={product} />
         ))}
       </div>
     );
   }
   ```

2. Client Components
   ```typescript
   'use client';
   
   export function AddToCart({ productId }: { productId: string }) {
     const [loading, setLoading] = useState(false);
     
     const handleAddToCart = async () => {
       setLoading(true);
       try {
         await addToCart(productId);
       } finally {
         setLoading(false);
       }
     };
     
     return (
       <button 
         onClick={handleAddToCart}
         disabled={loading}
       >
         {loading ? 'Adding...' : 'Add to Cart'}
       </button>
     );
   }
   ```

#### 2.2 Backend Architecture

```mermaid

   ```typescript
   // Product API Route
   export async function GET(
     request: Request,
     { params }: { params: { id: string } }
   ) {
     try {
       const product = await getProduct(params.id);
       return NextResponse.json(product);
     } catch (error) {
       return NextResponse.json(
         { error: 'Product not found' },
         { status: 404 }
       );
     }
   }
   ```

2. Middleware Implementation
   ```typescript
   // Authentication Middleware
   export function withAuth(handler: NextApiHandler): NextApiHandler {
     return async (req, res) => {
       try {
         const token = req.headers.authorization?.split(' ')[1];
         if (!token) throw new Error('No token provided');
         
         const decoded = verifyToken(token);
         req.user = decoded;
         
         return handler(req, res);
       } catch (error) {
         return res.status(401).json({ error: 'Unauthorized' });
       }
     };
   }
   ```

#### 2.3 Database Implementation

```typescript
// MongoDB Schema Definitions
import { Schema, model } from 'mongoose';

const ProductSchema = new Schema({
  name: {
    type: String,
    required: true,
    index: true
  },
  description: String,
  price: {
    type: Number,
    required: true,
    min: 0
  },
  category: {
    type: Schema.Types.ObjectId,
    ref: 'Category'
  },
  images: [String],
  stock: {
    type: Number,
    default: 0
  },
  ratings: [{
    user: {
      type: Schema.Types.ObjectId,
      ref: 'User'
    },
    rating: Number,
    review: String
  }]

    const product = {
      name: 'Test Product',
      price: 99.99,
      description: 'Test Description'
    };

    const created = await createProduct(product);
    expect(created.name).toBe(product.name);
    expect(created.price).toBe(product.price);
  });
});
```

#### 3.2 Integration Testing
```typescript
describe('Cart Integration', () => {
  it('should handle complete checkout flow', async () => {
    // Setup test data
    const user = await createTestUser();
    const product = await createTestProduct();
    
    // Add to cart
    const cart = await addToCart({
      userId: user.id,
      productId: product.id,
      quantity: 1
    });
    
    // Create order
    const order = await createOrder(cart.id);
    
    // Verify order
    expect(order.status).toBe('pending');
    expect(order.items).toHaveLength(1);
    expect(order.total).toBe(product.price);
  });
});
```
